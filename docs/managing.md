To publish this site to the web, change the Github repo settings to point towards the gh-pages branch at the-bookery.github.io. 

Then, with [Jekyll setup](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), run `bundle exec jekyll build` and publish the root contents of `_site` to gh-pages. 

This process has the possibility of being automated in Github Actions.
